# hpc-lagoon

A lightweight Linux HPC node built completely from source using LFS. Project explores systems internals, performance benchmarking, and minimal HPC clustering.

## Goals
- Build a minimal Linux OS using Linux From Scratch (LFS)
- Turn it into a benchmark-ready HPC node
- Network multiple nodes for parallel task execution
- Learn, document, and share the entire process

## Why?
Focusing on high-performance computing, systems, and datacenter engineeringâ€”and I want full control from bootloader to benchmark.

## Timeline
See `/docs/lfs-notes.md` for detailed progress.

## Stack
- LFS + custom kernel
- Bash, SSH, C for benchmarking
- VM or bare metal setup
